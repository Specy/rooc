# What it is
Rooc is a language and compiler to parse and convert formal mathematical models into a static formulation. Static formulations can then be fed to transformers to convert them to linear problems or linear problems in standard form.
The goal is to compile the binary to WASM and create a web wrapper to show all the individual steps needed to convert and find a solution to the model, this way people can more easily learn how to create and solve mathematical models.
The "language" supports formal definitions of problems, with the ability to call functions, declare constants, arrays and tuples. It also supports iterators and utility functions to iterate over graphs, edges, arrays, ranges, etc.
